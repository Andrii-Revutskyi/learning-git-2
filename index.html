    <h1>Pick Up the Phone <br />Henry Moodie</h1>
    <p>
      Said goodbye when I left to your answering machine Then you jumped in a
      plane, girl, you know what I mean Pick up the phone, oh yeah Pick up the
      phone, oh please I need your voice again Hearing your voice again Waiting
      so many years, feeling closer to you Not a sign, not a trace, baby, what
      can I do? Pick up the phone, oh yeah Pick up the phone, oh please I need
      your voice again Hearing your voice again
