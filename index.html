    <h1>Pick Up the Phone</h1>
    <h2>Henry Moodie</h2>
    <p>
      Said goodbye when I left to your answering machine.<br />
      Then you jumped in a plane, girl, you know what I mean.<br />
      <strong>Pick up the phone</strong>, oh yeah.<br />
      <strong>Pick up the phone</strong>, oh please.<br />
      I need your voice again.<br />
      Hearing your voice again.<br /><br />

      Waiting so many years, feeling closer to you.<br />
      Not a sign, not a trace, baby, what can I do?<br />
      <strong>Pick up the phone</strong>, oh yeah.<br />
      <strong>Pick up the phone</strong>, oh please.<br />
      I need your voice again.<br />
      Hearing your voice again.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your visiting</p>
